# Arena-simulation-project
Part 1:
Modeling four press-drills with associated machines, our Arena simulation spans 10,000 minutes, examining system performance under various conditions. The goal is to identify potential bottlenecks and enhance overall efficiency.

Part 2:
Utilizing Arena software, we simulate a system with three independent conveyors converging onto a main conveyor. Each conveyor exhibits distinct inter-arrival characteristics. Our 1000-minute simulation focuses on estimating accessing times and average package queues, providing insights into the efficiency of the conveyor system.
